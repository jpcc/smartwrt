# The package: source tree, Makefile, install scripts

Reference for what is where in `luci-theme-footstrap/`, what the Makefile does that a template
theme would not, and what runs on the router at install and removal time.

How the packages are actually built and published: [ci.md](ci.md).

`luci.mk` installs by directory presence — no install recipes needed:

| Source | Installed to |
|---|---|
| `ucode/*` | `/usr/share/ucode/luci/` |
| `htdocs/*` | `/www/` |
| `root/*` | `/` |
| `root/etc/uci-defaults/*` | picked up as `LUCI_DEFAULTS` |

Only `src/ luasrc/ htdocs/ root/ ucode/ po/` are copied verbatim. `styles/` is not in that list,
which is why `cascade.css` is generated in `Build/Prepare` straight into the build tree and is
absent from git.

**Never edit `cascade.css`.** Colours go in `styles/03-palettes.css`, scales and tokens in
`styles/02-tokens.css`. See [css.md](css.md).

**The web manifest is a static file, and that is a constraint, not a shortcut.** A theme may not
register a dispatcher node — it would outlive the theme that registered it — so there is nothing that
could render the manifest per request. Two values are fixed by that: `start_url`/`scope` are
`/cgi-bin/luci/`, uhttpd's own default, and `background_color`/`theme_color` are the DEFAULT palette's
page colour, since the manifest is read once at install time and cannot follow a live Appearance
change (it paints the splash and the installed window's chrome, never the page). Chrome's install
prompt needs a secure context, so over plain HTTP what this buys is iOS's Add to Home Screen — which
reads the `apple-touch-icon` link rather than the manifest — plus the icon itself. Regenerate it with
`node tools/build-icons.mjs` whenever `logo.svg` changes; `npm run icons` fails if you forget.

The committed file is **quantised to a 32-colour palette**, which is 4.6 KB where the browser's own
RGBA screenshot is 15.7 KB: the picture is a flat background, one ink colour and the ramp between
them, so a palette is the right encoding and the worst channel moves by 18 of 255 on 0.2% of the
pixels. That step is the one thing in this repo that wants **ImageMagick**, and only when
regenerating — `npm run icons` compares PIXELS in the browser it already runs, so a different
ImageMagick version is not a failure and a redrawn logo still is. Nothing in luci-base could stand in
for the icon, which is worth stating: it ships functional glyphs (interfaces, signal bars, ports) and
no logo or raster of any kind, and every theme carries its own.

## Makefile: what differs from a template theme

```makefile
PKG_NAME:=luci-theme-footstrap
LUCI_NAME:=luci-theme-footstrap   # pin: luci.mk keys the Build/Prepare hook name on LUCI_NAME,
                                  # which defaults to the checkout directory — the CSS build
                                  # would silently not run in a renamed checkout
FOOTSTRAP_VERSION?=               # CI injects it from the tag; locally the version is git-derived
LUCI_TITLE:=Footstrap Theme
LUCI_DEPENDS:=+luci-base          # the WHOLE dependency list
LUCI_PKGARCH:=all                 # noarch: one build for every target
LUCI_MAINTAINER / LUCI_URL        # otherwise the package claims "OpenWrt LuCI community"
LUCI_MINIFY_CSS:=0                # see below
PKG_LICENSE:=Apache-2.0           # the theme, and nothing else: it carries no webfonts
include $(TOPDIR)/feeds/luci/luci.mk   # ABSOLUTE, not ../../luci.mk: CI rsyncs the package into
                                       # package/, not into the feed
```

**Do not set `PKG_VERSION`.** `luci.mk` derives it from git; CI injects `FOOTSTRAP_VERSION` from
the tag, because an SDK build has no `.git` to derive from.

### Minification: CSS off, JS on two paths

Two different tools; confusing them is expensive.

- **`LUCI_MINIFY_CSS:=0` is mandatory.** luci.mk's CSS minifier is **csstidy**, old enough to
  mangle `:has()`, `color-mix()` and nested `calc()`: the package installs and the layout falls
  apart. `build-css.sh` minifies instead — a string-aware awk pass of its own.
- **`LUCI_MINIFY_JS` has two paths.** A release CI build pre-minifies with **terser**
  (`tools/minify-js.mjs`, which can mangle identifiers — jsmin cannot) and sets
  `FOOTSTRAP_PREMIN=1`, which turns `LUCI_MINIFY_JS` to `0`; jsmin on top of terser output would
  reopen the `return /re/` trap on forms terser legitimately emits. A build **without** node (SDK
  user, buildbot) keeps the default `1`, and jsmin minifies the untouched source. Both paths
  matter: comments are ~60% of the JS source, and uhttpd serves `/www` **uncompressed**, so those
  are bytes on the wire and in flash.

  The source therefore has to stay jsmin-safe — see the regex rule in
  [conventions.md](conventions.md).

### `Build/Prepare` — six steps, in this order

The hook (its name keys on `LUCI_NAME`) runs right after luci.mk copies the sources into
`PKG_BUILD_DIR`, and edits the **copy**:

1. **Copy `LICENSE`** into `PKG_BUILD_DIR` — `PKG_LICENSE_FILES` resolves against *that*, and
   luci.mk does not copy the package root.
2. **`build-css.sh`** → `cascade.css` in the build tree. `cat`/`awk` only, so it runs on the
   OpenWrt buildbot with no host toolchain.
3. **`mangle-tokens.sh`** — shorten the private `--fs-*` names, 16% of the sheet.
   **Before** step 4 on purpose: the reserved set is derived by reading the JS and the templates,
   so it must see them whole — and step 4 is what strips the template comments. It reads them from the **source** tree, never from
   `PKG_BUILD_DIR` — in CI the build tree's JS has already been through terser, its comments are
   gone, and five names that only appear in a comment would stop being reserved. That made the
   shipped sheet depend on *who* built it.
4. **`strip-templates.sh`** — the comments out of the `.ut` files: `{# … #}` template comments, and
   `/* … */` code comments **that own their lines**, wherever they sit (ucode inside `{% … %}`,
   JavaScript inside an inline `<script>`, CSS inside an inline `<style>`). 63 KB of templates
   become 21 KB, which is **−7.4 KB of the compressed package** — it went from 72.4 KB to 65.2 KB —
   and −7 KB on every page the router serves, since uhttpd serves `/www` uncompressed.

   The rule is what makes this safe, and it is not "remove `/* … */`": a comment is removed only
   when `/*` is the first non-blank thing on its line and `*/` the last on its (possibly later)
   line. To eat live code, a string literal would have to span lines *and* contain a line that is
   nothing but a comment; measured across every `.ut` here, 18362 of 18362 comment bytes are
   whole-line, none are inline, and no multi-line template literal contains a line-leading `/*`.
   Anything that does not fit the rule is left in place and counted — the tree has exactly one such
   case today, the glob `` `/usr/lib/lua/luci/i18n/*.${lang}.lmo` ``, whose `/*` is in a string.
   Verified on a live router, not only by reading: the pages the stripped templates serve are
   byte-identical to the ones the source templates serve, once the comments are removed from both
   (the only remaining difference is the session id).
5. **`strip-shell.sh`** — whole-line `#` out of the shell under `root/`.
6. **Stamp `FS_VERSION`** into `fs-version.js` with `sed`. The path is part of the contract —
   `dev-sync.sh` and `tools/stage.sh` run the same substitution, so moving the constant means
   fixing three places.
### The catalogue lives in `po/`, and luci.mk owns it

`LUCI_LANGUAGES` in luci.mk is `$(wildcard po/*)`, so a `po/` directory makes it bake a
`luci-i18n-footstrap-<lang>` package per language — the ordinary arrangement for everything in the
luci tree, and the only one [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/openwrt/) can translate,
which `CONTRIBUTING.md` names as *the* way to translate LuCI. Nothing in this package's own
`Build/Prepare` touches the catalogue.

It was `i18n/` from v0.8.5 to v0.12.x, which is what stopped the language packages being
generated. The reason was issue #6: the self-update script people had installed **at the time** picked
its asset with `grep -E '\.apk$' | head -1`, GitHub returns assets **sorted by name**, and
`luci-i18n-…` sorts before `luci-theme-…` — so the Update button installed a 6 KB catalogue
instead of the theme, reported success, and offered the same update forever. A script already on
somebody's router cannot be fixed remotely, so the *release* was fixed instead.

That script is retired, and the release is built by owfeed, which packages this theme as exactly
one artifact per format whatever luci.mk would have done. The constraint that bought the rename is
gone; the cost of keeping it — a catalogue the project's own translation platform cannot see — is
not. `tools/check-packages.sh` still asserts one theme package per format.

In the owfeed-built package the `.lmo` basename is **`footstrap-theme.<lang>.lmo`**, not
`footstrap.<lang>.lmo`: `lmo_load_catalog` globs `*.<lang>.lmo` so any basename loads, and keeping
the two builds' paths distinct means a router can carry both without a file conflict.

## uci-defaults: registration

`root/etc/uci-defaults/30_luci-theme-footstrap` is the **single source of truth** for
registration (`dev-sync.sh` runs the same file; nothing else registers the theme).

- Registers **one** entry: `luci.themes.Footstrap=/luci-static/footstrap`. Layout, palette, mode
  and rounding are **client** switches on the Footstrap tab.
- The key in `themes.<Name>` is CamelCase without hyphens — a uci option-name limitation.
- Links the three admin uploads into `/www`: `bg`, `pattern.svg` and the `fonts/` directory all
  live in `/etc/footstrap`, because uhttpd serves `/www` only and `/etc` is what a sysupgrade
  keeps. The pattern keeps its `.svg` name — uhttpd types a response by extension.

**It runs TWICE per install, not once.** Our `postinst` calls it, and OpenWrt's stock
`default_postinst` separately runs and then deletes every `/etc/uci-defaults/*` in the package.
The script is idempotent, so this is harmless.

**Fresh install vs upgrade is decided by the registration itself.** `mediaurlbase` is written only
in the run that first added `luci.themes.Footstrap`; on an upgrade the entry is already there, so
nothing moves a router off the theme it is on. `[ "$PKG_UPGRADE" != 1 ]` is checked beside it, as
the other themes in the tree do, but carries nothing on its own: apk never exports the variable and
neither does our postinst.

**It migrates nothing from older footstraps, on purpose.** A router is expected to `sysupgrade`
rather than upgrade single packages, so leftovers go with the image; what remains worth cleaning is
config, and the one config key this package owns is the theme entry. That was not always so — the
script used to delete eight legacy theme names, re-point four legacy media paths, carry the old
top-bar layout into `luci.main.footstrap_layout`, sweep two downloaded wallpapers and a pre-0.12.1
`fonts/` directory, and fall back to bootstrap if the active theme's files were missing. All of it
served installs that predate the first version published in the LuCI tree. Requested in review:
start from the assumption that a user of the official package started there.

## postinst / postrm

`postinst` re-runs uci-defaults, clears the LuCI caches and does **`rpcd reload`, never
`restart`**: rpcd holds sessions in memory, and a restart logs out every LuCI user — including
the admin who just clicked Update. `reload` sends SIGHUP, which re-reads
`/usr/share/rpcd/acl.d/*`, the only thing this package needs from rpcd.

`postrm` does three things, and exits early on an upgrade (`case "$1" in *upgrade*`) because opkg
runs the OLD package's postrm mid-upgrade — reverting `mediaurlbase` there is what once flipped
every updating 24.10 user back to bootstrap:

- deletes `luci.themes.Footstrap`;
- if our theme is still active, moves `mediaurlbase` back to bootstrap on a **two-part** check
  (both the media directory *and* the ucode template must exist: a one-sided check would hand the
  UI to a half-removed bootstrap, which is the white page this branch was written for);
- removes `/etc/footstrap` — the admin's uploads, kept out of the package so an upgrade preserves
  them, and a real removal is the one time they should go — and does `rpcd reload`.

## `/etc/config/footstrap` must be a conffile

The package ships `root/etc/config/footstrap` as an **empty stub that is written at runtime**:
"Save as default" has rpcd uci-set the router-wide axes into that very file
(`saveAsDefault()` in `fs-prefs.js`).

With no `conffiles` define, the package manager owns it as an ordinary file and **replaces it on
upgrade** — so the admin's saved defaults were wiped by the theme's own one-click Update, silently,
and reported as success. Measured on a live router: it held eight options, was package-owned, and
had no `.conffiles` entry beside base-files' and dnsmasq's.

Nothing observable fails when this regresses — the wipe happens on somebody else's router, months
later — so `npm run conffiles` gates it: every shipped `/etc/config/*` must be declared.

The uploaded background is the sibling case with the other answer. `/etc/footstrap/login-bg` is
written at runtime too, but it lives outside `/etc/config`, so a package upgrade never touches it
and a conffile entry would be rejected (the package does not ship that path). What *would* eat it is
a firmware **sysupgrade**, which keeps only what is listed — hence
`root/lib/upgrade/keep.d/luci-theme-footstrap`.

Three things now take that route, and `/etc/footstrap/` is where all of them live: the background,
the wallpaper pattern, and `/etc/footstrap/fonts/` — the webfonts `fonts/set-font.sh` installs,
along with the `@font-face` sheet it generates beside them. Each is exposed by a symlink under
`/www/luci-static/footstrap/` that uci-defaults recreates on **every** install and upgrade rather
than shipping, because `/www` is repopulated from firmware on a sysupgrade.

The fonts one links a **directory**, and that has two traps which end identically — `ln` exits 0 and
the link lands at `…/fonts/fonts`, one level too deep, so nothing serves and nothing complains:

- the path is already a symlink to a directory, and `ln -sf` follows it. `-n` is the fix;
- the path is a **real directory** — which every footstrap before 0.12.1 shipped here, full of the
  woff2 files it carried — and `-n` does not help. Measured on a 25.12 router: exit 0, link created
  inside. So the path is cleared first unless it already is the symlink we want, in uci-defaults and
  in `set-font.sh` alike.

No ACL entry goes with the fonts, and none should: `set-font.sh` is root on the router with a shell,
not a browser going through rpcd. Nothing in the UI writes those three options.

## ACL

`root/usr/share/rpcd/acl.d/luci-theme-footstrap.json` grants what the Footstrap tab needs to persist
a router-wide default and a login background:

- `uci` `set`/`commit`, scoped to the `footstrap` config — "Save as default";
- `cgi-io upload` plus `file` `write`/`remove` on `/etc/footstrap/login-bg` and
  `/etc/footstrap/pattern.svg` — the wallpaper photo and the tiled pattern;
- `file exec` on two literal commands, `/bin/chmod 644 /etc/footstrap/login-bg` and the same for
  `/etc/footstrap/pattern.svg` — an upload that is not world-readable is one uhttpd answers with 403.

Those two `file.exec` grants are the only ones the theme ships, and each is one fixed
argument-complete command.
There is no grant for self-update, because there is no self-update: the theme upgrades through the
package feed the installer adds.

rpcd **skips an unreadable file in `acl.d` and says nothing**, so a stray comma means the grant
is issued to nobody and nothing else notices. `npm run acl` (`tools/check-acl.sh`, also a step in
CI's `check` job) parses every shipped `acl.d/*.json` and additionally rejects a document that
parses but grants nothing — a list instead of an object, or an entry with neither `read` nor
`write`, both of which rpcd accepts just as quietly.

A related trap the page had to solve: `rpc.js` only raises on the ubus status code when the
declaration asks it to (`reject: true`). Without it, a per-config ACL refusal — `uci` granted,
`footstrap` not — **resolves** with status 6 (permission denied) and every `.then()` runs as if the
file had been written.

## `luci-upstream.pin`

The single source for the pinned `openwrt/luci` commit and the sha256 of the two borrowed tools
that CI **downloads and RUNS** as gates:

- `luci-base/src/jsmin.c` — decides whether the shipped JS is safe;
- `build/i18n-scan.pl` — decides whether the catalogue is complete. It lexes `.ut` (rewriting the
  template into JS before xgettext) and picks up the title from the rpcd ACL; a `grep` for
  `_('…')` does neither.

Taken from a moving `master`, these gates would be "whatever upstream pushed last"; the sha256
says so out loud. The same file pins `USIGN_PIN` (so the signer in CI and the verifier in the field
are the same code) and `OPENWRT_KEYRING_PIN` — the commit of `openwrt/keyring` the release SDK's
signing keys are read from, pinned from a *different* host than the tarball they verify.

It deliberately pins **no ucode**. The template compile-check moved into the `verify` containers,
where the router's own interpreter runs it against the installed templates on both release lines
([ci.md](ci.md)) — so there is no interpreter to build and no commit to keep current, and the file
says so in place to stop the pin coming back.

## The same package, twice: this tree and the luci tree

The theme **is in** [openwrt/luci](https://github.com/openwrt/luci) as
`themes/luci-theme-footstrap` (merged 2026-08-20), and the copy that lives there is **not** this
directory copied across. `tools/sync-luci-fork.sh <path-to-luci>` materialises it, and the
difference is one decision made twice.

**How a change gets there now.** Their `CONTRIBUTING.md` is the authority and the shape is
ordinary: a feature branch off a fresh `upstream/master`, one PR per change, subject
`luci-theme-footstrap: <lowercase description>`, a body that says why, and a `Signed-off-by` with a
real first and last name (a GitHub noreply address is refused). `git push -f` is explicitly the way
to update a PR — inside your own branch, never on master. Release branches (`openwrt-25.12`, …)
take bug and security fixes only; a new package never lands on one, which is why the theme reaches
users of a *release* through owfeed and reaches everyone else with the next OpenWrt release.

**Two things the sync cannot carry, and both have bitten once.** The far side's `Makefile` is
hand-maintained (`include ../../luci.mk`, `PKG_MAINTAINER`), so `postinst`, `postrm` and
`conffiles` have to be changed there as well — a postrm cleaned up here and not there is exactly
the kind of divergence nothing else notices. And `po/` belongs to **Weblate** over there: upstream
forbids editing catalogues by hand, so the sync no longer sends them, and a msgid change is its own
deliberate PR against `po/templates/`. `npm run fork-drift` lists every shipped file the two trees
disagree about and names those two separately; it is a report rather than a gate, because an
unproposed change is a legitimate difference.

**That tree gets the built stylesheet; this one keeps the layers.** Here, `styles/` is thirty-nine
files in four cascade layers whose *order* is the design, and `cascade.css` is a build artefact
this repository does not even track. There, the other four themes each commit one `cascade.css`
and have no build step at all — a theme arriving with its own build system asks a reviewer to
audit that before they can read a stylesheet. So the sheet is generated on this side and
committed on that one, and `styles/` plus the four shell scripts do not travel.

**Nothing else is optimised on the way.** Measured against the stock tree, no package in
`openwrt/luci` ships anything pre-minified: the four themes' stylesheets run 17–20 bytes per line
and `luci-base`'s own JS 28–29, i.e. ordinary source with indentation. So the copy keeps its
`--fs-*` names unmangled, its templates and shell keep their comments, and the JS goes over
untouched for `luci.mk` to run **jsmin** across at package time — which is what every other
package in that tree gets. The release path here does more (terser, `mangle-tokens.sh`, comment
stripping) and the packages differ by about 14% because of it: 76 321 bytes against 66 825.

The one place the copy still stands out is the sheet itself, at 128 bytes per line against the
stock 17–20, and the arithmetic is why it stays: unminified it is **467 615 bytes**, eight times
the largest stock theme, because this repository keeps the *why* beside each rule and in source
form those comments are 70% of the file. The choice there is not "like everyone else" versus
"minified" — it is 136 kB of minified sheet against 468 kB of prose.

Two more things the copy changes, both in the Makefile, which is the one file maintained by hand
on the far side and never overwritten by the sync:

- `include ../../luci.mk`, not `$(TOPDIR)/feeds/luci/luci.mk` — in-tree, that is the path.
- `PKG_MAINTAINER` rather than `LUCI_MAINTAINER`: 96 of 101 apps in that tree use the former, and
  the formality bot reads it.

Re-run the sync after any change under `styles/`, or the committed sheet is a stale artefact of a
source that has moved.
