/* A view's timer must survive a hidden tab as ITSELF — same handle, and still the router's to sweep.
 *
 * fs-router hooks `setInterval` so a client navigation can clear what the outgoing page left
 * running, and the hidden-tab pause rides that same registry. Both are right; the way it was done
 * was not, and neither half can be seen from a stand without winning a race:
 *
 *   * the pause CLEARED each timer and re-armed it on show, which hands back a NEW id, so a view
 *     holding its own handle to stop its poller was left with a dead number;
 *   * a paused timer carried outside the registry is one a navigation sweep cannot see, so a tab
 *     hidden across a click brings the previous page's timers back.
 *
 * So a paused timer STAYS in the registry (armed on nothing) instead of leaving it, and the handle
 * the view holds keeps naming it. Driven here rather than on a stand because both faults need a
 * visibilitychange to land inside a specific window; the harness dispatches it exactly. */
