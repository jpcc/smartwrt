/* The page gate: every page the router's menu offers, at every width that matters, measured for the
 * faults that have actually reached users.
 *
 * The static gates read the stylesheet; every field report so far was about a PAGE — a column
 * shredded to one character per line (#11), a submenu title clipped (#22), an indicator that did
 * not fit the sidebar (#14), a hidden tab pane leaving phantom scroll (#10), a doubled scrollbar
 * in Firefox (#12), a widget or a whole app laid out wrong (#5, #15, #32, #33, #36). Not one is
 * visible in a file, and every one is one DOM query away on a live page.
 *
 * WHAT IT LOOKS FOR: `doc-scroll` (the document scrolls sideways — the symptom users report as
 * "вёрстка плывёт", #1), `overflow` (past the content column with nothing to scroll it back),
 * `clipped` (a non-scroller whose content is wider than itself), `target` (a hit target under
 * 24x24 CSS px with a neighbour inside 24px of its centre — WCAG 2.2 SC 2.5.8 with its spacing
 * exception), `noname` (an operable element with no accessible name — SC 4.1.2, the one a11y
 * failure a stylesheet CAN cause), `ungated-table`/`unanswered-table` (see below),
 * `nested-scroll` (two scrollports stacked on the shell), `geometry` (the chrome's model against
 * the real box) and `console` (a view that threw while rendering). The width sweep starts at 320,
 * which is the narrowest reflow WCAG 1.4.10 requires.
 *
 * A BASELINE, NOT A CLEAN SHEET. Some findings belong to the app, not the theme, and a gate that
 * fails on them is a gate that gets disabled. So every finding is signed `path|width|kind|element`
 * and the known set lives in tools/baselines/live-audit.json: a NEW signature fails the run, a
 * signature that stopped appearing is printed so the baseline can shrink. A ratchet, exactly like
 * css-metrics.mjs. The file is a UNION ACROSS PLATFORMS, not a photograph of one machine — text
 * metrics differ between a maintainer's containers and CI's runner, and a few findings sit within
 * a pixel of their threshold.
