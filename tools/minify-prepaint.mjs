/* Minify the inline <script> blocks inside the shipped templates.
 *
 * These are the largest bytes in the package that nothing was shrinking. `strip-templates.sh`
 * removes comments and says so — "it does not minify: no joining of lines, no touching of anything
 * that is not a comment from column one" — so the pre-paint went to the wire with full indentation
 * and full identifiers. And it is the most expensive place to pay: it is in the HTML document
 * itself, before a single module is fetched, on every page AND on the login page, which downloads
 * no modules at all. Measured over the shipped templates: 10,625 B of script in, 2,176 B saved.
 *
 * ONLY blocks with no ucode interpolation are touched. `partials/head.ut`'s first block is the
 * `window.__fsSD = {…}` data object, 23 `{{ … }}` substitutions that are ucode expressions and not
 * JavaScript at all — terser would parse `{{ _sd_lay }}` as a block statement and rewrite it into
 * something ucode never emits. A block containing `{{`, `{%` or `{#` is left exactly as it is.
 *
 * Over a BUILD TREE, never the checkout — same rule as minify-js.mjs, and for a sharper reason
 * here: tools/axes.mjs and tools/chrome-fence.mjs both read `head.ut` as TEXT and match it with
 * regexes pinned to its literal shape (`/function set\(dark\)\s*\{([\s\S]*?)\n\t{4}\}/`). Minify
 * the source and those gates stop being able to read the file they exist to hold.
 *
 * CI-only, like the JS minifier: an SDK build has no node and keeps the source, which is the trade
 * already accepted for the shipped modules.
 *
 * Usage: node tools/minify-prepaint.mjs <ucode-dir> */
