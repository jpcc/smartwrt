 * a level is read as `color:` about as often as `background:`. So each level owes three things:
 *
 *   LEGIBLE AS TEXT   AA (4.5:1) on all three surfaces. Bootstrap does not manage this (its
 *                     --primary-color-low is 3.6:1 on its own dark panel), which caps our ramp.
 *   LEGIBLE AS A FILL the matching --on-*-color clears AA on top of the level.
 *   A REAL GRADATION  high/medium/low must be three distinguishable colours. They were once three
 *                     aliases of ONE token and nothing caught it — a flat colour passes every
 *                     contrast threshold there is; only a spread check fails on it. */
