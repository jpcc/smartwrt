/* The poll tick, performed on purpose: does a freshly replaced data table ever get laid out before
 * anything has answered for it?
 *
 * luci-base's poll does not append a row, it REPLACES the table, and the replacement carries none of
 * the marks fs-select stamps. For the moment between landing and being stamped the table is a
 * full-width table — at 390px several screens taller than the card stack it is about to become — and
 * if anything forces layout in that moment the engine re-anchors on the intermediate and throws the
 * reader (612px out and back, twice per tick, on a live router at iPhone width).
 *
 * WHY A DELIBERATE TICK RATHER THAN WATCHING A REAL ONE. The intermediate lasts a microtask:
 * fs-select answers in a MutationObserver callback, before paint, so a per-frame sampler never sees
 * it — measured, with the rule removed, as 0 frames out of 108 while the page grew by 269px. The
 * only way to observe the state is to force layout inside that window, which is exactly what an app
 * reading a width right after rendering does, and what this reproduces.
 *
 *   node tools/table-tick.mjs [--only owrt2512] [--widths 390,768] [--pages /admin/status/overview]

 * Needs a running owlab router (docs/development.md). */
