/* Build the stylesheet for a gate to measure. One copy.
 *
 * The stylesheet is GENERATED (build-css.sh concatenates styles/), so a gate must build it and
 * never measure a stale copy left over from the last run. Three tools said that in three ways and
 * had already drifted three ways — two used mkdtemp and one a fixed name under a shared /tmp, two
 * silenced build-css.sh and one did not, and only css-dup passed --dev. The fixed-name variant is
 * also what once forced a `name` parameter on this API — callers invented 'cascade-export.css'
 * purely to avoid colliding with each other. mkdtemp makes the name a non-question, so do not
 * re-add the knob. */
