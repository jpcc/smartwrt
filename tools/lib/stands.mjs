/* The live half of the gates: one place that knows how to reach a running router, log into LuCI and
 * enumerate its pages.
 *
 * Every static gate here measures a FILE. The bugs that reached users measured a PAGE — a column
 * shredded to one character per line (#11), a submenu title clipped (#22), a doubled scrollbar in
 * Firefox (#12), a third-party app's tabs laid out wrong (#36, #33, #8), a client navigation that
 * painted less than a full load (upstream review). None can be seen in a stylesheet; all are one
 * query away on a live page.
 *
 * The routers are owlab's — `owlab status -json` names each one and the port it answers on, so
 * nothing here hard-codes a port or a container name. Nothing here boots anything either: a gate
 * that starts and stops containers by itself is a gate nobody runs locally. */

 *
 * owlab boots four: two distributions x two releases. Three axes vary across them — the package
 * manager, the LuCI release and the distribution — and only two can change what this theme is
 * measured against: the second distribution is the same luci-base with a different brand and app
 * set, has never been the leg that caught something first, and doubles a wall clock that is already
 * the reason people skip running the gates.
 *
 * So the default is the OpenWrt pair, which still covers both package managers and both release
 * lines, and `--all` (or `--only imm2512,…`) takes the full set. docs/releasing.md asks for the full
 * set before a tag, where the wall clock is worth paying. */
