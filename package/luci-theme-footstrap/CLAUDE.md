# CLAUDE.md

`luci-theme-footstrap` — a LuCI theme for **OpenWrt 24.10 and newer** (and ImmortalWrt). Standalone:
it ships no framework and depends on nothing but `luci-base`. Page content is rendered client-side
by app view-JS, so the theme is server chrome (`ucode/template/themes/footstrap/*.ut`) + one
generated `cascade.css` + `fs-*.js` in `htdocs/luci-static/resources/`.

**Communicate in Russian.** Code, comments, commit messages and PR text stay in English.

`styles/base/` began as a fork of `luci-theme-bootstrap`'s cascade.css and is footstrap's code now:
**do not call it "the fork" or reintroduce the word bootstrap** into filenames, comments or docs.
That name is legitimate only for the *other, real* package — the `/luci-static/bootstrap` fallback
in `uci-defaults`, the `bench/` baseline, and the Apache-2.0 attribution in `styles/00-header.css`.

## Read the doc first

`docs/` is the reference and every page carries the measurement behind each rule. This file is the
index plus the rules that are easy to break — do not re-derive what a doc already settled.

| Touching | Read |
|---|---|
| what LuCI expects of a theme, where the boundary runs | `docs/architecture.md` |
| the rule list with the gate that holds each one | `docs/conventions.md` |
| dev routers, pushing a change, proving it | `docs/development.md` |
| `styles/`, cascade layers, `build-css.sh`, `@mirror` | `docs/css.md` |
| tokens, palettes, type, the Appearance axes | `docs/design-system.md` |
| sidebar / bar / rail, the menu renderer, the fit | `docs/chrome.md` |
| client navigation | `docs/spa-router.md` |
| foreign `luci-app-*`, the fence | `docs/third-party-apps.md` |
| Makefile, uci-defaults, postinst/postrm, ACL | `docs/package.md` |
| CI job graph, owfeed, packaging, the trust chain | `docs/ci.md` |
| pre-release checklist, changelog contract, runbook | `docs/releasing.md` |
| the navigation benchmark | `docs/benchmark.md` |

`docs/luci-app-styling-guide.md` (+ `_ru`) is outward-facing, for authors of other packages.
`docs/gallery.html` renders every widget LuCI or any app can emit — it is what `a11y` and
`export-tier` measure, and how the theme is checked without a router.

**Repo root is the workspace** (`package.json` gates, `tools/`, `docs/`, `owlab.yaml`,
`install.sh`); the shipped package is `luci-theme-footstrap/` one level down — same name, one level
apart, so a path is ambiguous unless it is absolute or rooted. Nothing in the root ships, and the
OpenWrt buildbot has no node.

**Work from the repo root, not from its parent.** The checkout's parent holds `luci-fork/` (the
openwrt/luci copy, see below) and `tmp/` and is not a git repository — a session started there
loads none of this file, and `owlab` exits with `no owlab.yaml found`.

## Commands

```sh
npm run check                              # every gate, one run; must exit 0 before pushing
npm test                                   # the unit suite alone (node --test, no browser)
node tools/build-icons.mjs                 # re-raster the app icons after a logo.svg change
owlab up | owlab sync --watch | owlab open owrt2512
./tools/stage.sh && owfeed build           # both formats into dist/
owlab test --release 25.12.4 --install 'dist/noarch/luci-theme-footstrap-*.apk' --assert …
ucode -T -c -o /dev/null <template>.ut     # syntax-check a template the way LuCI does
luci-theme-footstrap/dev-sync.sh <host>    # deploy to a HARDWARE router over ssh
./tools/sync-luci-fork.sh ../luci-fork     # regenerate the openwrt/luci copy
npm run fork-drift                         # what the two trees disagree about
```

`npm test` (`node --test tests/*.test.mjs`, no browser) is the unit half and it is **deliberately
narrow**: only the branches a stand cannot enter — a luci-base missing a surface the router calls, an
alias loop or a `firstchild` tie no shipped menu contains. One file: `node --test tests/<name>.mjs`;
one case: `--test-name-pattern`. Anything about layout or behaviour belongs on a live userland
(`owlab`, or a hardware router), never in a stub. `npm run check` is the whole static half.

One gate directly: `node tools/<name>.mjs`. Two run in CI only: `tools/jsmin-verify.mjs` (needs a
jsmin built from `luci-upstream.pin`) and `ucode -T -c` over every template, which the `verify`
containers run against the installed theme. Two `owlab test` invocations, one per format —
`--install` is a host-side glob evaluated per router, and the fifth assertion is that same template
compile.

## Rules that are easy to break

### Verifying
- **Every gate is static; not one opens a page.** A behaviour change is not finished until it has
  run on a real userland on **both** package managers (25.12/apk and 24.10/opkg). A stubbed node
  harness proves a module initialises, nothing more — say which of the two you did.
- **23.05 is over, at 0.14.2.** It cost one widget (`ui.RangeSlider` arrived in 24.10, the Appearance
  tab is built in one try/catch, and the whole tab died there until a user reported it) and upstream
  declined to carry that code (openwrt/luci#8978). `install.sh` serves a 23.05 router the pinned
  0.14.2 and says it is the last one; the stand, the contract entry and the fallback are gone. The
  floor is 24.10 — `npm run live -- --all` covers what is left. docs/releasing.md.
- **One fault, one mechanism — and prove that one holds alone.** A second mechanism added "to be
  safe" must be measured with the first one on its own: if the probe still passes, the spare was
  never needed and does not ship. The Appearance tab's vanishing after a Save (openwrt/luci#8981)
  went in with an attribute watch AND a retry ladder, both landed together, both passed; the ladder
  turned out to catch nothing, and a maintainer had to ask. A suspicion about risk is an experiment
  to run, not a justification to write into a comment.
- **`/security-review` before every release and every upstream PR.** It reads the branch diff, so it
  is run once the branch is final and before the tag or the `gh pr create` — not after. The surface
  worth the pass is small and always the same: the installer's signature chain, any new shell that
  runs over a build tree, the login template (that page is unauthenticated), sinks in the browser JS,
  and the packaging pipeline. A maintainer asked outright whether one had been done
  (openwrt/luci#8981); "yes, and here is what it covered" is a one-line answer only if the pass
  actually happened.
- **Prove a CSS change with a computed-style diff, not screenshots.** Live counters move 0.5–1.3% of
  pixels between two runs of the *same* sheet while a real regression weighs 0.19%.
- Screenshots and any other scratch artefact go in `../tmp/`, never inside the checkout.

### Comments
- **Minimally sufficient: the shortest text that still carries the reason.** An inline comment is
  one line, two if the reason needs a number; a block is justified only when it covers several
  rules at once, and a module header is a short paragraph, not a page. Anything longer belongs in
  `docs/`, pointed at from the code in one line. Cut every word that removing does not lose a fact.
- **A comment says why, not what.** One that restates the line it sits on is deleted, not reworded.
  What a reader cannot recover from the code is the reason: the constraint, the alternative that
  failed, the number that was measured.
- **Carry the measurement, not the adjective.** "overflows" is unfalsifiable; "19-109px of overflow,
  once per poll tick, on Firewall/DHCP/Wireless" tells the next reader whether the rule still earns
  its place and how to re-run the check. Same for widths, timings, counts, and the viewport and
  density they were taken at.
- **A negative result stays, in one line** — "tried X, it did Y" is the cheapest way to stop the
  next session re-trying it (`display: none` on top of a zeroed tab pane buys nothing: scrollHeight
  1039 either way). The narrative around it does not stay: how it was first written, what was
  renamed, which attempt came in which order. Current state, present tense.
- **A number or a name in a comment is part of the contract.** 15 comments said the poll re-renders
  "once a second" while `pollinterval` ships at 5 s — a claim that reads as measured and was not.
  The comment changes in the same edit as the code, or it becomes a lie git preserves forever.
- **References are the part that cannot be rebuilt**: issue numbers (#19, openwrt/luci#8981), spec
  text quoted verbatim (WCAG SC 1.4.10's exception, HTML-AAM), upstream commits, file paths. A
  compression pass may cut the sentence around them; it may not cut them.
- **Some comments are code**: `@mirror name/tag` / `@endmirror` (`npm run mirror`), `/* fs:probe */`
  (`strip-probes.sh`), the eslint `'require …'` pragmas, and the Makefile's buildroot signature line
  that scan.mk greps for, which must stay last with nothing between it and the text it announces
  (`npm run marker`). Reword one and a gate or the build breaks — silently, in the Makefile's case.
- **Formal English, no theatre** — no exclamation, no shouting a fix, no addressing the reader. A
  module header states purpose and invariants; an inline comment explains the rule it sits above and
  nothing else. Never stack a second comment on the first: edit the one that is there.
- **Comments cost no router bytes.** `strip-templates.sh`, `strip-shell.sh` and `build-css.sh` remove
  every one at package time and git keeps every word, so **never trade a "why" away for bytes**. A
  stale comment is worse than none.
- **A comment inside a quoted command string is part of the string** — the `#` lines inside
  `ssh "$R" "…"` in `dev-sync.sh` keep their escaped backticks and `$`. Run `sh -n` after any such
  edit.
- **After a bulk comment pass, prove the code did not move**: a token-stream compare against HEAD for
  every JS file, a comment-stripped and whitespace-normalised diff for CSS, `.ut`, shell and yaml.
  That is what caught a deleted Makefile marker and a lost shell escape; no gate would have.

### CSS
- **`htdocs/luci-static/footstrap/cascade.css` is generated — never edit it.** Source is `styles/`.
- Layer order `tokens, base, theme, page`, one directory per layer, filename prefix = source order.
  A later layer beats an earlier one regardless of specificity, so a theme rule never needs
  `!important` to outrank base.
- **Read the private `--fs-*` tier only.** The `--*-color-*` export tier is defined from it and read
  by nobody inside `styles/` (`audit --strict` fails). A hostile `:root` recoloured 312 of 336
  gallery elements before the split, 0 after.
- **`!important` is a gated allowlist and inverts layer order.** A flag must fight an inline
  `style=` or an app's unlayered rule; one that beats another footstrap rule means the rule is in
  the wrong layer. `theme/95-a11y-media.css` is the one sanctioned exception.
- **Edit the rule that already styles the selector** — never append a second one. **Win on
  specificity, never on source order.**
- **Coverage is a contract.** Never delete a selector because no stock page renders it — some
  third-party app emits it. `css-orphans` is the only safe dead-CSS search, and only because `fs-*`
  is ours alone.
- **No colour literals** (`--fs-scrim` excepted); a tint of X is mixed **from** X. Never reintroduce
  a component bridge (`--*-rgb`, `--*-hsl`).
- **Merge a duplicate or pin it in `@mirror`.** An unpinned duplicate is a hard failure, and so is a
  `@mirror` group with one copy.
- **`styles/base/` is editable**, but prefer the matching `styles/theme/` file, and justify any base
  edit that changes output with a near-empty computed diff.
- **No bold mono**: `<strong>` is a LABEL and must be *assigned* the sans face — excluding it from
  the mono rule changes nothing, since it still inherits.

### JS
- One concern per module; `L.require` makes a singleton and throws `DependencyError` on a cycle, so
  a module can never `extend` another — compose by calling.
- **All "does it fit" logic lives in `fs-fit.js`.** Measure uncollapsed, re-fit synchronously on a
  mutation, coalesce on resize. `data-narrow` — not a viewport media query — is the single source of
  "the sidebar became a bar", and the widths are read from the CSS tokens with `getComputedStyle`,
  never copied into JS.
- **Never put a regex literal straight after `return` or `=>`** — jsmin eats the rest of the file
  and **exits 0**. Wrap it: `return (/^https?:\/\//i.test(a));`. No backtick inside a `${…}`.
- **Require a stock class through `window.L`** (`const RT = window.L; RT.require(name)`) — the `L` a
  factory receives has no `ui` helpers, and `require()` caches the first requirer's binding.
- **`FS_VERSION` stays in `fs-version.js` at that path** — the Makefile, `dev-sync.sh` and
  `tools/stage.sh` sed it by path; moving it makes every release report "(dev)".
- **The theme never checks for its own updates and never reaches a third-party host at run time.**
  Upgrades are the package manager's job (the installer adds the feed). `fs-router` exports
  `onNavigate(fn)` so an optional module can register itself without the router naming anyone —
  keep that seam inverted, but do not re-add an updater behind it.

### The chrome, and sharing a document with third-party apps
- **One theme entry, one template dir, one renderer.** Layout is a **client** axis
  (`:root[data-layout]`, always an explicit value) — never write a `:not([data-layout=…])` guard and
  never add a second renderer. The bar is the base; the vertical sidebar is one guarded override
  that wins on specificity.
- Three zones: **ours** (`fs-*`, `--fs-*`, `[data-fs-chrome]`), **shared LuCI** (`.cbi-*`, `#view` —
  where an app is *entitled* to win on specificity), **theirs**. Check who owns a name before
  "fixing" a collision: `.left`/`.right`/`.center` and `ul.nav` are LuCI's.
- The chrome is defended by **not matching**: the mark in `header.ut`, the fence in `fs-sheets.js`,
  the pin in `theme/10-chrome.css` (inherited properties, roots alone). `npm run chrome-fence`
  derives the mark from the markup and compares whole canonical strings — a token-wise check once
  passed on a fence that was the exact inverse of one.
- **A view's CSS is never deleted** — a sheet imported at module eval never comes back. An invasive
  sheet makes the next navigation a full load instead; only a byte-identical duplicate may be
  dropped.
- Every Appearance axis is implemented twice (pre-paint in `partials/head.ut`, live in
  `fs-prefs.js`) and **the custom property is set BEFORE the attribute** — reversed, a reload paints
  one frame in the previous hue. `npm run axes` derives the contract from the JS.

### Package and release
- **`+luci-base` is the whole dependency list and keeping it that way is a constraint.** `curl` is
  not in OpenWrt's default set — fall back to `uclient-fetch` instead of adding a dep.
- **The catalogue lives in `po/`** — what `LUCI_LANGUAGES` globs and what Weblate translates.
  luci.mk emits the per-language packages; nothing in `Build/Prepare` compiles a catalogue. It was
  `i18n/` while a fielded self-update script mis-picked a multi-asset release with `head -1` (#6);
  owfeed now builds exactly one theme artifact per format regardless, which `tools/check-packages.sh`
  still asserts in CI's build job.
- Anything under `root/etc/config/` MUST be in the `conffiles` define (`npm run conffiles`) — else
  the manager replaces it on upgrade and the theme's own Update wipes the admin's saved defaults,
  reporting success.
- `postinst`/`postrm` use **`rpcd reload`, never `restart`** — restart logs out every LuCI session.
- A malformed `acl.d/*.json` is skipped by rpcd **silently**, so the grant goes to nobody and only
  Save-as-default and the background upload break, on someone else's router (`npm run acl`).
- `root/etc/uci-defaults/30_luci-theme-footstrap` is the single source of registration; fresh
  install vs upgrade is the marker file `/usr/share/luci-theme-footstrap/.installed`, and **an
  upgrade must never change the active theme** (`$PKG_UPGRADE` is dead — apk never exports it).
- Do not set `PKG_VERSION` (git-derived). `LUCI_MINIFY_CSS:=0` — csstidy mangles `:has()` and
  `color-mix()`.
- **Never post a comment on the upstream PR** — not a reply to a review thread, not a status note,
  not a summary of what was fixed. A review finding is answered in the DIFF and by marking the
  thread resolved; the commit message and the changelog carry the reasoning. Anything that has to
  be said to a human is said here, in this session, not on the PR.
- **The theme is IN openwrt/luci** (merged 2026-08-20 as `6f08de76`), so the proposal branch is
  history and so is amending it. Upstream work is now one **feature branch per change**, cut from
  a fresh `upstream/master`, and their `CONTRIBUTING.md` is the authority:
  - subject `luci-theme-footstrap: <lowercase description>`; a body that says why; **`Signed-off-by`
    with a real first and last name** — a `@users.noreply.github.com` address is refused;
  - `git push -f` is explicitly fine *inside your own PR branch* (amend, `rebase -i`) and is how a
    PR is updated; never on master;
  - release branches (`openwrt-25.12`, …) take **bug and security fixes only** — no new packages,
    which is why the theme is not in the 25.12 feed and will not be;
  - **translations are Weblate's**, not ours: `po/` no longer travels with the sync.
- **`tools/sync-luci-fork.sh ../luci-fork` materialises the copy, but two things it cannot carry**:
  the far side's `Makefile` is hand-maintained (postinst/postrm/conffiles must be changed there
  too) and `po/` is Weblate's. The script says so on every run, and `npm run fork-drift` lists
  every shipped file the two trees disagree about — a report, not a gate: an unproposed change is
  a legitimate drift.
- **A release is not finished when the tag pipeline is green** — the theme installs from
  owfeed-packages, so it also has to reach the feed: bump `packages/luci-theme-footstrap/upstream.sh`
  (the bot opens that PR for some releases and not others), check the sha256s in the diff against
  the release assets you downloaded, merge, and then read the **served** index rather than the
  workflow log — `apk adbdump` on `releases/25.12/<arch>/packages.adb` and `Packages.gz` on
  `releases/24.10/<arch>/`.
- **The trust chain fails closed**: a verified TLS channel (never `-k`, never as a retry), an
  ed25519 `usign` signature, then GitHub's sha256. The signature is the link that holds — GitHub
  *computes* the asset digest, so a swapped asset passes the checksum. A missing digest, `.sig` or
  usign is a refusal, not a downgrade.
- A `_()` with no catalogue renders silently in English: run `luci-theme-footstrap/update-po.sh`
  after touching any `_()`. A msgid is a **global** name shared with every app — Appearance labels
  carry the `footstrap` msgctxt; the chrome, the login/notice sentences and the
  System/Memory/Storage titles deliberately do not.

## Commits and the changelog

- **Conventional Commits, message in English. Never commit OR PUSH without an explicit instruction
  for that action, each time.** Finished work, green gates, a verified fix or an answered review is
  not authorization, and yesterday's "commit and push" covers yesterday only. This holds for BOTH
  remotes — `origin` here, and the openwrt/luci fork behind the PR, where the amend + push
  `--force-with-lease` sequence is a push like any other. Leave the tree dirty and say what would go
  in and where it would go; wait to be told. No co-author / "Generated with" / AI attribution
  trailers. `origin` is the only remote of THIS repository.
- **NO COMMIT LANDS WITHOUT ITS CHANGELOG ENTRY.** It goes under `## [Unreleased]`, in the **same
  commit as the code**, and in **BOTH `CHANGELOG.md` AND `CHANGELOG_ru.md`** — never one now and
  its mirror later. An entry written afterwards is written from the diff, and the diff is exactly
  what does not know why. This covers documentation, benchmarks, CI and packaging too, not just
  code: if the commit is worth making, it is worth one line saying what changed. The only things
  that skip it are this file and a fix to an `[Unreleased]` entry already written.
  `npm run changelog` fails on a mismatch between the two files, so a missing mirror is a red gate,
  not a note for later.
- Sections are `Added / Changed / Deprecated / Removed / Fixed / Security / Performance`, one of
  each per version, in that fixed order — append into the section that already exists in its
  canonical slot, never add a second `### Changed` on top.
- Each entry is `- **one-line effect.** then the rationale`. The bold lead **is** the release note
  (`release-notes.sh` emits leads only), so it must read on its own — **a bullet with no bold lead
  is silently dropped from the release**. Write the effect, not the diff; keep the measurement.
- Cutting a release: `docs/releasing.md`, and the order is load-bearing — checklist, rename the
  heading and add the compare link in both files, `npm run changelog`, commit, **then** tag that
  commit.
