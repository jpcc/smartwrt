/* The chrome's cut, asked once and answered the same way twice.
 *
 * "How wide is the content column" is asked in two places for two reasons: `fitShell()` decides
 * whether the sidebar still fits beside it, and `contentWidth()` answers a table's mid-scroll
 * question, where reading layout is forbidden. They are the same arithmetic — the window less the
 * sidebar (or the rail, or nothing) less the shell's gutter — and written twice they drifted:
 * `--fs-content-pad` is one side's padding, already doubled by shellGeometry(), and contentWidth
 * subtracted it a second time: 56 CSS px of column that does not exist. And `data-narrow` is not the
 * only chrome with no sidebar beside it — fitShell returns early on the top-BAR layout and removes
 * the attribute on the way out, so contentWidth, which read only that attribute, went on
 * subtracting a 224px sidebar from a window that has none.
 *
 * Neither is visible in a screenshot: the wrong answer only matters when it crosses fs-select's
 * CRAMPED threshold, and then it cards a table that had room and un-cards it a moment later. What
 * this test may NOT check — that the inputs describe the real page — is checked on a stand, where
 * tools/live-audit.mjs compares contentWidth() against the live `.fs-content` box. */
