/* @mirror — turn duplication you cannot delete into duplication that cannot ROT.
 *
 * Some duplication is forced rather than chosen: CSS cannot share a declaration block across two
 * mutually exclusive guards — the stacked table's card layout is needed under a CLASS (.fs-stacked,
 * the measured data table) AND under a CONTAINER QUERY (the config table, which cannot be measured;
 * see fs-select.js). A script fetched with `curl | sh` and running BEFORE the package exists cannot
 * source a library shipping inside that package, yet has to do exactly what it does.
 *
 * The trap: a structural duplicate detector (tools/css-dup.mjs) matches bodies that are IDENTICAL,
 * so it goes QUIET the moment two copies diverge — exactly when it should shout. Not hypothetical:
 * the fetch helper existed twice and had ALREADY drifted three ways (different backend order, one
 * with no timeout on its first-choice tool, one missing the https redirect pin) and nothing said a
 * word. So: tag every copy, assert they stay byte-identical. */
