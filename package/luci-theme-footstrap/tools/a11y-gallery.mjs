/* Accessibility gate — axe-core (WCAG 2.2 AA) over docs/gallery.html.
 *
 * The gallery, not the router: LuCI renders content client-side, so auditing a real page needs a
 * router, a session and a network. The gallery is a static file rendering every widget LuCI or a
 * third-party luci-app-* can emit, with the real class names — the theme's whole widget surface,
 * checkable in CI with no device. The full palette x mode x tint matrix is 24 runs, because a
 * palette switcher multiplies the contrast matrix and colour failures regress silently in the
 * combination nobody looks at: that is how the 1.69:1 white-on-green in hicontrast dark survived
 * as long as it did.
 *
 * Fails on `serious`/`critical` only; `moderate`/`minor` print but do not gate, the gallery
 * rendering widgets out of any page context (isolated <table>s, headings with no document
 * outline), which trips landmark and heading-order rules that say nothing about the theme. */
