/* The reader's place, on an engine that will not keep it.
 *
 * A poll tick changes the height of things above the reader and the page below moves. Chromium and
 * Firefox hide that with scroll anchoring; WebKit has never implemented it, so on Safari and on
 * every iPhone the same tick moves the page under the reader's thumb.
 *
 * The theme does that job where nobody else does (fs-fit.js, ENGINE_ANCHORS). This gate holds both
 * halves of that sentence, since both can break silently:
 *
 *   held      with the engine's anchoring suppressed AND the theme's fallback forced on, a growth
 *             above the fold must move the reader by no more than a pixel or two.
 *   floor     the same refill with the correction switched off (`fsAnchor = 'off'`): the content
 *             column holds its height between ticks, so the document never gets short enough to be
 *             clamped. It can only be measured with the other half silent.
 *   swapped   a section refilled the way `dom.content()` refills one — emptied, then filled again —
 *             must leave the reader where they were too. The moment in between has no height, and
 *             `held` cannot see that: a growth only ever inserted never collapses anything.
 *   not twice with the engine's anchoring left alone, the same growth must move the reader just as
 *             little — a fallback that also ran there would throw the page the other way.
 *   quiet     while the reader is SCROLLING the theme must not correct at all: a correction landing
 *             inside a flick is itself a jump.
 *
 * The growth is inserted rather than waited for: a real tick depends on what the router's radios are
 * doing, and a gate that only fails when a station happens to join is not a gate.
