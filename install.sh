# luci-theme-footstrap installer for OpenWrt 24.10 (opkg) and 25.12+ (apk). A 23.05 router is served
# the pinned final release instead — see FROZEN_2305_TAG. The feed carries the two branches the
# package FORMAT splits on and nothing else.

#   wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/VizzleTF/luci-theme-footstrap/main/install.sh | sh
#
# The same script is attached to every release and served from the release CDN, which has no
# per-address budget — the address raw.githubusercontent.com rate-limits is the one a user behind
# CGNAT shares with everyone else (issue #17). That copy is signed, so it can be verified before it
# is run as root:
#
#   wget -qO- https://github.com/VizzleTF/luci-theme-footstrap/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
#
# It adds the owfeed-packages feed and installs the theme from it, so `apk upgrade` / `opkg upgrade`
# carries the theme forward afterwards; the feed index is verified by the package manager against
# the key pinned below. Running it again upgrades the theme. Licensed Apache-2.0.
